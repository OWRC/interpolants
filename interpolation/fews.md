# Delft-FEWS
[Delft-FEWS](https://www.deltares.nl/app/uploads/2015/01/Delft-FEWS_brochure-2017.pdf) (Flood Early Warning System) is an industry-standard "platform for real time forecasting and water resources management". Its strength is that it, as a stand-alone product, can web-scrape, interpolate, (temporally) aggregate, inspect and re-generate data from any source; it is truly a generalized water data management tool.

Here it is used to organize data collected from a variety of sources and consolidates them to a single data product we offer to our partners.
