# Delft-FEWS
[Delft-FEWS](https://www.deltares.nl/app/uploads/2015/01/Delft-FEWS_brochure-2017.pdf) (**F**lood **E**arly **W**arning **S**ystem) is an industry-standard "platform for real time forecasting and water resources management." Its strength is that it, as a stand-alone product, can web-scrape, interpolate, aggregate and re-generate data from any source; it is truly a generalized water data management tool.

FEWS can even integrate with hydrological models, by creating input data, running the model, and imports model output â€” all at the click of a button.

But most importantly, the FEWS platform offers a streamlined user interface that allows professionals the ability to inspect their data, prior to use.

At the ORMGP, FEWS is used to organize data collected from a variety of sources (international, federal, provincial, municipal, academia and private organizations) and consolidates them to a single spatially-distributed, temporally-aggregated data product we offer to our partners and utilize internally.
