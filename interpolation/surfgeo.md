The Ontario Geological Survey's 2010 Surficial geology of southern Ontario has been infilled to capture the extent of the greater ORMGP area. The layer is hosted on the ORMGP image server and is used to distribute potential infiltration rates across the ORMGP jurisdiction. Infilling was accomplished using the OMAFRA [Agricultural Resource Inventory](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cf961d62ee1345c7b191808c9d60a4d7) and is detailed in the [metadata page](/metadata/surfaces/surficial_geology.html). The final product is contiguous across the extended ORMGP area and is used (for instance) to parametrize the ORMGP [water budget model](/interpolants/modelling/waterbudgetmodel.html#land-use-and-surficial-geology).
