# Introduction
The [ORMGP](https://maps.oakridgeswater.ca/) maintains a current, continuous daily climatology dataset beginning 1901. The data are interpolated to [some 3,000 ~10kmÂ² sub-watersheds](https://owrc.github.io/interpolants/interpolation/subwatershed.html) and are made available through our [web portal](https://maps.oakridgeswater.ca/Html5Viewer/index.html?viewer=ORMGPP).

The data serve many purposes from basic overlay with other disparate data sets (e.g., hydrographs) to providing input to hydrological models. 

Clearly, data collection is constrained by public/private funding, open date sharing policies and technology; so the data served are a compilation of what is deemed the best for *our* needs and thus originate from a number of sources. Specifically, we are concerned  climatology *regional scale*.
