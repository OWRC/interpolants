# Critical Temperature $(T_c)$

Precipitation data can come in the form of just that: "precipitation", without information of whether it's in the snow (solid) or rain (liquid) form. A simple solution would be to determine a "critical" temperature $(T_c)$ from which precipitation falls either as snow or rain:

$$
\text{Rainfall}=
\begin{cases}
\text{Precipitation}, & T_a>T_c\\
0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\text{Snowfall}=
\begin{cases}
\text{Precipitation}, & T_a\leq T_c\\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$


where $T_a$ is air temperature measured at land surface and is assumed to have some linear positive correlation with the temperature of the planetary boundary layer (Oke, 1987). Below, it is discussed how an optimal $T_c$ is determined for each of the 2,183 ~10km² [sub-watersheds delineated](/interpolants/modelling/waterbudgetmodel.html#sub-basins) across the [ORMGP](https://www.oakridgeswater.ca/) jurisdiction.

# Data Collected

# Results
```{r resultsLoad}
df <- read.csv("interpolation/calc/rdpa-criticalTemperature/dat/tcrit-summary.csv")
df.noSNODAS <- read.csv("interpolation/calc/rdpa-criticalTemperature/dat/tcrit-summary-noSNODAS.csv")
```

For this exercise, we need a complete and concurrent $P$ and $T_a$ time series, since the data have been interpolated to our sub-watersheds, we have 2,813 of such time series. The limiting time step is 6-hours to match that of the CaPA-RDPA product. We also need a constraint, and seasonal snowmelt $(P_M)$ estimated using SNODAS aggregated to the same sub-watershed network is taken as the benchmark. Assuming the mass of $P_M$ originates as a proportion of total $P$ and that $T_a$ is a good predictor of its origin (i.e., snowmelt occurs in cold conditions) then we should be able to *"parse-out"* $P$ into its 2 (general) components: rain and snow.

**Note:** The SNODAS availability into Canada only began at 2010. For the previous seasons, a regional [cold-content snowpack model](https://owrc.github.io/interpolants/modelling/waterbudget/snowmeltCCF.html) was employed to estimate $P_M$ (which includes rain on snow events).

Now, at every sub-watershed, independently for each of the 19 seasons, $T_c$ is determined by computing:

$$
  P_S=
  \begin{cases}
  P, & T_a\leq T_c\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
$$

For every "water year" season (Oct.-Sept.), $T_c$ is optimized such that:

$$
  \sum P_S \to \sum P_M
$$
That is, total annual snowfall predicted using $T_c$ is equal to the total snowmelt predicted by SNODAS, year by year. This results in `r format(nrow(df),big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` separate $T_c$ optimizations averaging `r round(mean(df$tc), 1)`°C, with a mean residual/error $\left(\left|\sum P_S - \sum P_M \right|\right)$ of `r round(mean(df$diff),1)` mm, roughly `r round(mean(df$diff)/10,1)`\% of annual average precipitation. Below are the distributions of these results.


```{r plot1}
p0 <- df %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(tc)) + 
  ylim(c(NA,12000)) + 
  labs(x="Tc (°C)")

p1 <- df %>% ggplot() + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_histogram(aes(diff)) + 
  ylim(c(NA,12000)) + 
  xlim(c(NA,25)) + 
  labs(x="residual (mm)")

grid.arrange(top="Distribuiotn of Tc and residuals",p0, p1, ncol=2)
```

Seasonally, there does appear to be a ~6-year oscillation around the mean, even after 2011, when the SNODAS data are used:

```{r plot2}
df %>% ggplot(aes(wy,tc)) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = c(.9,.9)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group=wy)) + 
  geom_hline(aes(colour="blue", yintercept = mean(df$tc)), size=1.25, linetype='dashed', alpha=.7) +
  stat_smooth(aes(colour = "red")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2011, y = -5, xend = 2020.75, yend = -5), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"), ends='both')) +
  annotate('text', x = 2013, y = -4, label = "SNODAS") +
  labs(title="Annual distribution of Tc", x="water year", y="Tc (°C)") +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("blue","red"), labels=c("mean","GAM fitted"))
```


The overall mean $T_c$ sat within the inter-quartiles of the set of optimized critical temperatures for 12 of 19 seasons.

Operationally, when needing to apply $T_c$ to real-time $P$ estimates, the mean critical temperature of `r round(mean(df$tc), 1)`°C is used> This analysis will only apply to past seasons, once complete.



## Discussion

As a simple validation, annual total precipitation, averaged over the 2,813 sub-watersheds is compared with total precipitation interpolated from station data. Overall the 2 data sets are follow each other, with no obvious sign of the 6-year occillation mentionned above.

```{r plot5}
df %>% select(-c("tc","diff","msum")) %>%
  gather(src, precip, -sid, -wy) %>%
  ggplot(aes(wy,precip, fill=src)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.85,.2)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.85, position = "dodge") +
  # geom_segment(aes(x = 2011, y = 500, xend = 2020.75, yend = 500), size = 1, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"), ends='both')) +
  # annotate(geom="label", x = 2013, y = 500, label = "SNODAS", fontface = "bold", fill = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual("source", values = c("psum" = "#0161e0", "psum2" = "#ff3975"),
                    labels = c("psum" = "CaPA-RDPA", "psum2" = "MSC (scalar)")) +
  # scale_y_continuous(limits=c(500,NA),oob = rescale_none) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of regional precipitation", y="Precipitation (mm/yr)", x="water year")
```

Overall, regional $T_c$ managed to remain close to the freezing point as would be expected. There are some rare $T_c$ outliers; however every optimum seemed to converge to negligible residuals (\<percent annual precipitation).

Based on these results, the CaPA-RDPA precipitation field have been successfully parsed into the $P_R$ and $P_S$ components at the 6-hour time step, then aggregated to daily time steps.

### comparison with CCF model

The optimization routine was also performed without SNODAS, as a means of validating the [CCF model](https://owrc.github.io/interpolants/modelling/waterbudget/snowmeltCCF.html) used for data infill. Below show the negligeable difference in optimal $T_c$ selection and residuals.

```{r plot3}
df %>% ggplot(aes(wy,tc)) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = c(.9,.9)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group=wy), outlier.shape = NA) + 
  stat_smooth(aes(colour = "red")) + 
  stat_smooth(data=df.noSNODAS,aes(wy,tc,colour = "blue")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2011, y = -5, xend = 2020.75, yend = -5), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"), ends='both')) +
  annotate('text', x = 2013, y = -4, label = "SNODAS") +
  labs(title="Annual distribution of Tc", x="water year", y="Tc (°C)") +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("blue","red"), labels=c("no SNODAS","GAM fitted"))
```

```{r plot4}
df %>% ggplot(aes(wy,diff/psum*100)) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = c(.9,.9)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group=wy), outlier.shape = NA) + 
  stat_smooth(aes(colour = "red")) + 
  stat_smooth(data=df.noSNODAS,aes(wy,diff/psum*100,colour = "blue")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2011, y = -0.1, xend = 2020.75, yend = -0.1), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"), ends='both')) +
  annotate('text', x = 2013, y = -0.05, label = "SNODAS") +
  labs(title="Annual distribution of optimizaiton residuals", x="water year", y="residual (% annual precipitation)") +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("blue","red"), labels=c("no SNODAS","GAM fitted")) +
  ylim(c(-0.1,1.25))
```



### $T_c$ distribution

Lastly, as a final validation step, annual $T_c$'s distributed across the ORMGP sub-watershed network is inspected for irregularities. Notice the increased resolution offered by SNODAS.
