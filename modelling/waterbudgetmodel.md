* Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry [Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) Version 3](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/documents/lio::southern-ontario-land-resource-information-system-solris-3-0/about), April 2019
* Ontario Geological Survey [surficial geology of southern Ontario, 2010](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/surficial-geology-of-southern-ontario).
* Ground surface elevations were collected from the 2006 version of the [Provincial (Ministry of Natural Resources) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/maps/mnrf::provincial-digital-elevation-model-pdem/about). This is a 10x10mÂ² DEM derived from 1:10,000 scale OBM base mapping based on photogrammetic elevation points and 5m contours where the photogrammetic elevation points did not exist.
