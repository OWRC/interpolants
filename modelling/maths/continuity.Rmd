## The continuity equation

The continuity is the "strong" form of the conservation of energy that is constraned to a particular location:

$$
  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \textbf{j}=\sigma
$$
where $\rho$ is the amount of the quantity $q$ per unit volume $V$, $\textbf{j}$ is the flux of $q$ ($\textbf{j}=\rho\textbf{u}$), $t$ is time and $\sigma$ is the source ($\sigma>0$) or sink ($\sigma<0$) term.

$$
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \textbf{q}=\sigma
$$
