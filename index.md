# Introduction
There's a need for an introduction here, highlighting the need to:
* coordinate disparate datasets so that correlation among environmental phenomena can be investigated
* data are sourced primarily from open datasets and are ingested into our database
* by virtue of being in our database, web applications allowing users to analyze the data become available
* this is a system of delivering information needed for water resources and planning.
